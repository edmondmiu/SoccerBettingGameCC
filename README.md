  # Soccer Betting Game Application

  This is a code bundle for Soccer Betting Game Application. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/XlqlKBtkVbT6BkYv6gmn6w/Soccer-Betting-Game-Application.

  ## Project Overview

  This project is a client-side React application that simulates a real-time, multiplayer soccer betting game. It's built with Vite, and it uses `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS for the user interface. The application's architecture is modern and follows common React best practices, including a component-based structure and the use of custom hooks for state management.

  The core of the application is the `useMultiplayerSimulation` hook, which encapsulates the game's logic and state. It simulates a multiplayer environment, including other players' bets and reactions, to create a dynamic and social user experience. The application is designed as a prototype and does not include a real backend; all multiplayer features are simulated on the client side.
