DEBUGGING THE BETTING ISSUE:

The problem is that StickyBettingDrawer receives `addToBetslip` function from Match component, but this function only adds to the betslip array - it doesn't place bets.

The Match component has `handleAddToBetslip` function which actually places bets, but StickyBettingDrawer is getting `addToBetslip` instead.

I need to find where StickyBettingDrawer is rendered in Match.tsx and change:
  onAddToBetslip={addToBetslip}
to:
  onAddToBetslip={handleAddToBetslip}

This will make full-match betting work properly by directly placing bets instead of adding to betslip.
